## TODO:
- pawn upgrade once it gets to end (create separate menu)
- add regex for input to avoid exception raising
- menu screen (check gui.rb)
- input validation (turn inputs, pawn upgrade, menu choice)
- load game should only happen at start (option in menu screen)
- raw exit should save temp file with current save (and offer a continue 
- option at start)

## EXTRA FEATURES (things that will make quality of life easeier):
- instruction manual (for movements)
- create save files to test out all the functionalities (later you
  can change / include cool puzzles)
- chess notation (Ke2)
- pawn movement with only one pos (e4, f5, etc)
- documentation of methods (how it takes the input / output)

## BUGFIXES & Improvements:
- Compress knight_check, pawn_check, and king_check
(one method that takes directions as a parameter)
- pawn single movement (e4)
