## TODO:
- input validation (turn inputs, pawn upgrade, menu choice)
- end game screen

## EXTRA FEATURES (things that will make quality of life easeier):
- prettify menu screen
- documentation of methods (how it takes the input / output)
- multiple save files

## BUGFIXES & Improvements:
- Compress knight_check, pawn_check, and king_check
(one method that takes directions as a parameter)
- pawn single movement (e4)
